3.5 Git branches in general

        A. What command shows the branch you're currently on?

        B. Create a branch from "master" to "devel". Switch to it. Why
           don't you want to work in master?



3.5 Answer 
    

    A.For seeing the current branch one is working on need to type the command 
    $git branch --show-current 

 Or only this command will show all the branches in the current directory 

   $git branch 



    B.For creating a new branch from master to level at first we need to pull all the information from current branch as it will updated later on .
So first 
  $git pull 

Then we need to use the command for creating a new branch 
  $git checkout -b "devel"

Now if we want to push something to this newly created branch all we need to do is 

  
  $git push origin "devel" 

We can use -f in case we want to override everything .
