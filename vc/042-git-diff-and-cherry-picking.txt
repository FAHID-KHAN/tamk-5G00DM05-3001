4.2 Git diff and cherry picking

        Branches are used to isolate work.

        A. Make two commits. Take a diff
           between your current work in branch and two commits ago.
           Attach the output of the diff.

        B. Make a change in a branch.
           Cherry pick this individual commit to "master".

    At the first commit I have added this file and now I am going to make an another commit .
 Here is the output of the diff 
git diff HEAD^
diff --git a/4.2.txt b/4.2.txt

B. Make a change in a branch.
           Cherry pick this individual commit to "master".

 Currently I am in main branch but at first I am going to change this to another branch which is master and then I am going to commit something there and pick those commits from there to my main branch .


I want to get my previous commit from the file which was the last commit and I used this command 
$ git cherry-pick 0330c9be9850884fce672e7a6478d0135476a18e
