4.3 Git reflog

        A. What is a reflog? How do you list it?

        B. Add file. Commit it. Add another file. commit it.
           Ooops those were mistakes. Use reflog to find your COMMIT
           that was before TWO ADDS and reset your repository to this
           point.

        C. Hmm, on the other hand -- you want to keep those two new
           ADDED FILES. Use reflog to locate the position and
           reset your repository to COMMIT that includes the TWO
           files. Like it was in step A.



4.3 Answer 

 Git keeps track fo updates to the tip of branches using a mechanism which is called reference log or reflogs .Many git commands accept a parameter for specifying a reference or ref which is a pointer to commit .

The most basic reflog use case is invoking 

$git reflog

Another is a short cut which is equivalent to 

$git reflow show head 

The output will be something like this 

eff544f HEAD@{0}: commit: migrate existing content bf871fd HEAD@{1}: commit: Add Git Reflog outline 9a4491f HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from master to git_reflog 9a4491f HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from Git_Config to master 39b159a HEAD@{4}: commit: expand on git context 9b3aa71 HEAD@{5}: commit: more color clarification f34388b HEAD@{6}: commit: expand on color support 9962aed HEAD@{7}: commit: a git editor -> the Git editor
