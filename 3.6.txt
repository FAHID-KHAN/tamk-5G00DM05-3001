3.6 Git branches and creating them

        Branch from "devel" to "feature-1", commit to "feature-1" and
        merge changes back to "devel".

                                       merge
            master: o -- o             *
                          \           /
            devel:         o -- o -- o

 At first we have created a new branch from master which is devel and from devel then we created a new branch called feature 1 and now we will push this to branch feature1
