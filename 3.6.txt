3.6 Git branches and creating them

        Branch from "devel" to "feature-1", commit to "feature-1" and
        merge changes back to "devel".

                                       merge
            master: o -- o             *
                          \           /
            devel:         o -- o -- o



 3.6 answer 

 At first we have created a new branch from master which is devel and from devel then we created a new branch called feature 1 and now we will push this to branch feature1 

 For pushing this file into the feature1 at first we need to give the command 

  $git push -f origin "feature1"


Now we want this to merge in devel so we just give a simple command to change it to devel branch like before and we want to get the feature from feature1 

Now we give the command in this branch to merge the feature from feature1 

 $git merge feature1
